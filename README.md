# ProtoESP

ProtoESP hardware and documentation files ^_^ The intention for this repo is to host the hardware source files - eventually.
It will also have documentation sources - i.e. pinout diagrams configuration files!

All the derivative files will go into the "Releases" tab.

# I need schematics/gerbers/documentation files/etc

The "Releases" tab will have files with board derivative files (gerbers, schematic PDFs, STEP and so on),
as they are added!

Need files? [Please go to the "Releases" tab!](https://github.com/CRImier/ProtoESP/releases)

Not everything is done yet, at this point in time. Currently lacking things:

- Documentation (except for everything that hardware source and derivative files can provide)
- Lasercut backing files
- JLCPCB or PCBWay order-ready files for "in-house assembly" specifically (gerbers are not enough, it needs specially processed pick&place and BOM files!)

Contact me if you need help with some of these files ASAP!

# Reproduction

This board intention is that you can produce it on your own! The files published in "releases" should help you with that!
